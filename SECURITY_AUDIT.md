# Security Audit Summary

## Date: 2025-01-24

### ✅ Security Checks Completed

#### 1. Secrets and Credentials
- **Service Account JSON**: `nvidia-blog-agent-sa.json` is properly excluded from git (untracked)
- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive values are read from environment variables, not hardcoded
- **API Keys**: All API keys are read from environment variables (`RAG_API_KEY`, `INGEST_API_KEY`)
- **Credentials**: Uses Application Default Credentials (ADC) in production, no hardcoded credentials

#### 2. .gitignore Updates
Added to `.gitignore`:
- `*-sa.json` - Service account JSON files
- `*service-account*.json` - Service account files
- `*.key`, `*.pem` - Private key files
- `credentials.json` - Generic credentials file
- `state.json`, `*.state.json` - State files (may contain sensitive data)

#### 3. Code Security Review
- ✅ No hardcoded API keys or passwords found
- ✅ No hardcoded project IDs or corpus IDs
- ✅ Test files use dummy values (`secret123`) which is acceptable
- ✅ All sensitive configuration uses environment variables
- ✅ Service account paths use placeholders (`/path/to/...`) in documentation

#### 4. Test Results
- ✅ **189 tests passing** - All tests pass successfully
- ✅ No test failures or errors
- ✅ RSS feed parsing tests included and passing

### 🔒 Security Best Practices Followed

1. **Environment Variables**: All secrets loaded from environment variables
2. **ADC (Application Default Credentials)**: Production uses ADC, not JSON keys
3. **Secret Manager**: Documentation recommends Secret Manager for Cloud Run
4. **No Hardcoded Values**: No sensitive values hardcoded in source code
5. **Proper .gitignore**: Service account files and state files excluded

### 📋 Files to Review Before Commit

#### Untracked Files (New):
- `.dockerignore` - ✅ Safe to commit
- `Dockerfile` - ✅ Safe to commit
- `SETUP_ENV.md` - ✅ Safe to commit
- `scripts/kaggle_notebook_example.py` - ✅ Safe to commit (uses placeholder URL)
- `scripts/run_eval_vertex.py` - ✅ Safe to commit
- `scripts/test_rss_feed.py` - ✅ Safe to commit
- `scripts/test_service_local.py` - ✅ Safe to commit
- `service/app.py` - ✅ Safe to commit

#### Modified Files:
- All modified files reviewed - ✅ No secrets found
- Documentation updates - ✅ Safe

#### Excluded Files (Correctly Ignored):
- `nvidia-blog-agent-sa.json` - ✅ Properly excluded (service account)
- `.env` - ✅ Properly excluded (environment variables)
- `state.json` - ✅ Properly excluded (may contain sensitive data)

### ⚠️ Notes

1. **env.template**: File was deleted. SETUP_ENV.md contains template content inline, which is acceptable.

2. **Test Values**: Test files use `secret123` as dummy API keys - this is acceptable for testing purposes.

3. **Placeholder URLs**: Example files use placeholder URLs (e.g., `https://nvidia-blog-agent-xxxxx-uc.a.run.app`) - this is acceptable.

### ✅ Ready for Commit

All security checks passed. The repository is ready to be pushed to the branch.

**Recommendation**: Before pushing, ensure:
1. No `.env` file is committed (already in .gitignore)
2. No service account JSON files are committed (already in .gitignore)
3. Review the diff one more time: `git diff` and `git status`
